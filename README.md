This notebook walks you through:
- Cleaning and preparing startup project data 
- Visualizing how deadlines vary with tech needs

##  Tech Used

I’ve used Python and some powerful libraries to make things work smoothly:
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data wrangling
- `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualizations
- `ipywidgets` for interactive filters and controls

To get started, you can install all needed tools in one go:
```python
!pip install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib seaborn ipywidgets
```
